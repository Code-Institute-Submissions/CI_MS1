#### Design

**Color Scheme**

The site uses a dark grey and light blue color scheme chosen for its great fit with the background hero image. It is easy on the eyes and and energetic, in theme with the purpose of the website.

**Typography**

The site uses two fonts, Orbitron and Ubuntu. Orbitron is used for titles, headers and the like for its eye-catchiness and sleekness. Ubuntu is the font used for all other purposes. Sans-serif is the fall-back font for both.

**Imagery**

The background hero image goes together well with the color scheme of the page and reflects the facilities provided by Ascendant Fitness. The rest of the pictures are either profile images on customer reviews or more images of the facilities on the Locations page.

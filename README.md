## Design

**Color Scheme**

The site uses a dark grey and light blue color scheme chosen for its great fit with the background hero image. It is easy on the eyes and and energetic, in theme with the purpose of the website.

**Typography**

The site uses two fonts, Orbitron and Ubuntu. Orbitron is used for titles, headers and the like for its eye-catchiness and sleekness. Ubuntu is the font used for all other purposes. Sans-serif is the fall-back font for both.

**Imagery**

The background hero image goes together well with the color scheme of the page and reflects the facilities provided by Ascendant Fitness. The rest of the pictures are either profile images on customer reviews or more images of the facilities on the Locations page.

## Features

* The site is responsive on all screen sizes.
* Each page includes a navigation bar to allow for site navigation.
* Each page includes a footer that includes easy access to social media links and copyright information.
* User reviews: the main page includes a Testimonials section. It allows visitors to examine customer reviews without visiting social media of the service.
* About Us includes an in-site navigation element. They detail the main facets of the service, and steps to start a guided fitness program.
* The Contact page includes a contact form. It is used by visitors to sign up for an initial consultation. There is no location for the form to be sent to, but let that be noted here.
* The Locations page shows an image of each location, along with physical address and opening times. Clicking on the addresses will also open a tab for visitors to view the location on Google Maps.

**Features To Implement**

* A darkening overlay for the Locations images upon mouseover, with the street address and opening times text appearing on the darkened image.
* The Contact form currently does not match the overall color theme of the site, and alternate styling that fits better with the dark gray/light blue color theme is desirable.
* New page for a gallery with images of trainers and customers.
* Staff page.
